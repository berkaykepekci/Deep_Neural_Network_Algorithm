This repository includes the deep neural network algorithms and extensions I wrote, after taking the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" Course from deeplearning.ai.

There are 3 different notebooks:
  
    -my_algorithm_class: I wrote the given algorithms with myself.
    -my_alg_class_experimental: The algorithms I wrote in an attempt to increase the accurancy_scores. I used functions in order to implement "early stopping,
                                activation function tuning and learning rate tuning". After the implementations: train and test accurancy scores increased from
                                0.98 to 1.00 and 0.80 to 0.86, respectively.
    -deep_neural_classification: Last version of the complete algorithm and tuning functions. It can be used as python module (.py)
